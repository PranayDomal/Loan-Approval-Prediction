# Loan-Approval-Prediction
The aim of this project is to build and evaluate a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of loan approval based on an applicant’s financial profile and credit history, using historical lending decisions, while balancing approval rate and credit risk through disciplined evaluation and threshold selection.
